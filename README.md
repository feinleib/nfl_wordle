# "Kittle: NFL Wordle"

## About "Kittle"
Welcome to "Kittle: NFL Wordle"! "Kittle" is a textual Wordle-style game, and it is written and played in R.

I wrote this game in the fall of 2021, and it is inspired by the original [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game by Josh Wardle, along with prior sports spin-offs [Poeltl](https://poeltl.dunk.town) by Gabe Danon and [MLB Pickle](https://mlbpickle.com) (originally titled WARdle) by Jeremy Frank and Zach Ellis. I created this game before the publication of the popular NFL Wordle game [Weddle](https://www.weddlegame.com), and I took no inspiration from Weddle.

NFL fans will recognize that this game is named after San Francisco tight end George Kittle.
